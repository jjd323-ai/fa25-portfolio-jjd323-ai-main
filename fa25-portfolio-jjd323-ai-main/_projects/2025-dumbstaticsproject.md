I had to do this super overcomplicated statics project that literally could have just been submitted as a pdf and taken half the time, one-hundredth the effort, and would have looked just the same. 


It innvolved maximizing the height to which a box of the heaviest possible weight could be lifted. I used and excel spreadsheet to model multiple possible scenarios for acctuator placement and chose from all of those scenarios which accutator could lift the maximum possible weight up to .5m.
