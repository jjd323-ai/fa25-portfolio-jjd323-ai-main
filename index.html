<h3 style="text-align:center;">Reducing Spotted Lanternfly Contamination During Mechanical Grape Harvest</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
During mechanical grape harvest, spotted lantern flies (SLF) remain on the vines and can be collected with the fruit, contaminating loads...
</p>

<h2>Why This Matters to the End-User</h2>
<p>
Solving this problem would allow vineyards to avoid yield loss from post-harvest washing...
</p>

<h2>Proposed Directions</h2>

<h3>Smoke Machine Attached to Harvester</h3>
<p>
Attach a smoke (or similar gas) delivery system to the front of the harvester...
</p>

<h3>Bristles as a Filter</h3>
<p>
Install a system of brush bristles along the inner conveyor...
</p>

<h2>Our Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Will SLF consistently disperse when exposed to smoke or exhaust?</li>
<li>Are there grape regulatory or flavor concerns?</li>
<li>How long will it take for SLFs to return?</li>
<li>What are the constraints to modifying the harvester?</li>
<li>Is there space for bristles inside most harvesters?</li>
</ul>
